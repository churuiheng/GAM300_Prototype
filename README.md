# TenYenStudios: GAM300 Prototype

**Game Name:** Rapid Ride Fight  
**Game Description:** Rapid Ride Fight is a 4v4 Capture The Flag game where players pilot high-speed jet boats and bash their way to victory. The game takes place in a dystopian future where sea levels are high and cities are destroyed and abandoned.  
  
**Developed with Unreal Engine 4.27.1**  
  
## Controls
**WASD - Movement**  
**Hold Spacebar - Drift while moving**  
**J - Use Nitrous**  
**K - Fire Laser**  
**L - Place Mine**  

## Controls for Controllers:
**RT - Thrust**  
**Left thumbstick - Steer**  
**A - Drift**  
**X - Use Nitrous**  
**Y - Laser**  
**B - Place Mines**  

## Debug Controls
**1 - Spawn as Red Team**  
**2 - Spawn as White Team**  
**3 - Chinatown Asset Level**  
**4 - Chinatown Blockout**  

## Objective
Find the enemy base, capture the flag and return to base to score.  
"Destroy enemy boat and capture as many flag as possible within 5 minutes!"  

## Notes
- Boosting and drifting requires the boat accelerating to take effect.  
- Use key 1 or 2 (Spawn as xxx Team) to respawn if stuck  
- Swapping team might not spawn you in the correct team spawn and the flag does not reset if holding onto one  
- Laser does not hit multiple enemies at the moment and is able to hit enemies through walls  
- AI is still using the pickup system and not updated to use the new abilities system  
- Intended advantage of each ability is not implemented yet such as laser being able to destroy mines
